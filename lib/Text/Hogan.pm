=head1 NAME

Text::Hogan - A mustache templating engine statement-for-statement cloned from hogan.js

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Text::Hogan is a statement-for-statement rewrite of
L<hogan.js|http://twitter.github.io/hogan.js/> in Perl.

It is a L<mustache|https://mustache.github.io/> templating engine which
supports pre-compilation of your templates into pure Perl code, which then
renders very quickly.

It passes the full L<mustache spec|https://github.com/mustache/spec>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Text::Hogan::Compiler;

    my $text = "Hello, {{name}}!";

    my $compiler = Text::Hogan::Compiler->new;
    my $template = $compiler->compile($text);

    say $template->render({ name => "Alex" });

See L<Text::Hogan::Compiler|Text::Hogan::Compiler> and
L<Text::Hogan::Template|Text::Hogan::Template> for more details.

=head1 TEMPLATE FORMAT

The template format is documented in
L<mustache(5)|https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html>.
